## Overview

### Project Goals

We set out to build the "Smart Todo List" project which should be able to not only track a users tasks, but also automatically classify them into certain categories.

## Process

We first collaborated on planning out our app by visiting user stories. From that, the database schema, a wireframe, and routes were planned. It was decided that we could split the work into frontend and backend and we set out to get each part functioning separately.

Some research was done into data sources that might help us to classify our tasks. After getting developer access to the APIs, we collaborated on the logic to process the data and reduce the output to a single backend route that could control the classification of new tasks upon creation.



### Built With
